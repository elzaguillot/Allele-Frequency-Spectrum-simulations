Allele-Frequency-Spectrum-simulations/theta
Written by Elsa Guillot elza.guillot@gmail.com - Massey University
This code produces simulations for a wide range of theta to find the average simulated allele frequency spectrum that fit the best the simulations
To run the entire code the must execute he following sequence:

bash simulate.sh
python process.py
Rscript analyse.R
