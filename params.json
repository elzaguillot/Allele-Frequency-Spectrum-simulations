The code for this analysis is provided in the 'theta' repository.\r\n\r\nPart 2: Finding the variance of the allele frequency distribution\r\n\r\nThe aim is to place confidence intervals on the observed allele frequency distribution from one million coalescent datasets.  The code for this analysis is provided in the 'AFS' repository.\r\n\r\nNote: runtimes for both parts of this analysis are long (hours to days).  Y chromosome coalescent trees are generated with ms and transformed to 8 fully-linked STR loci using microsat.  Output files are parsed with Python and R.  For each section, the entire analysis has been automated as a bash script.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\nThe following computer requirements to needed to run the code:\r\n\r\n- UNIX operating system\r\n- R\r\n- Python\r\n- ms: http://home.uchicago.edu/~rhudson1/source/mksamples.html\r\n- microsat: http://massey.genomicus.com/software.html#microsat\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\nHudson R. 2002.
